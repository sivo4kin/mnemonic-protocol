# Trust and Reputation Layer

## What it is

Mnemonic can evolve into a trust and reputation layer for A2A networks.

This means using historical memory and contribution records to help answer questions like:

- which agents are reliable in this domain?
- which contributors produce useful outputs over time?
- which sources are noisy or adversarial?
- which agent outputs are consistently validated downstream?

## Why it matters

In larger multi-agent systems, declared capabilities are not enough. An orchestrator also needs trust signals.

A2A can help agents find and delegate to each other, but it does not inherently provide a durable record of contribution quality.

Mnemonic can supply that layer by linking:

- agent identity
- memory entries
- downstream usage
- validation outcomes
- acceptance or rejection signals

## Example scenario

A shared research network has multiple specialist agents:

- retrieval agent
- summarization agent
- citation checker
- synthesis agent

Over time, Mnemonic tracks which agents:

- contribute relevant material
- produce low-error outputs
- get reused successfully in downstream tasks
- generate artifacts later confirmed or rejected

This history becomes a reliability signal for future orchestration.

## What Mnemonic contributes

- persistent contribution history
- linkable evidence for trust scores
- memory-backed reputation signals
- basis for weighted retrieval or routing decisions

## Relationship to existing Mnemonic direction

This fits naturally with the project's existing work on:

- per-entry signing
- reliability scoring
- adversarial mitigation
- source weighting

## Why this role is promising

It gives A2A systems a missing ingredient:

> not just who can do a task, but who has historically done it well.

## Why this role is later-stage

This role depends on accumulated usage data and careful score design. It is strategically strong, but not the first use case to lead with.
