# Task Memory Ledger

## Pattern summary

Use Mnemonic as the persistent ledger for A2A task execution history.

Each task exchanged in an A2A workflow leaves behind a durable record that can be retrieved later.

## What gets stored

For each task, Mnemonic can record:

- task request hash
- assigned agent identity
- task summary
- intermediate notes
- output summary
- artifact references
- completion status
- timestamps and ordering anchors

## Why this pattern is useful

A2A workflows often involve many short-lived tasks. Without durable task memory, agents repeatedly lose context such as:

- what has already been tried
- what assumptions were made
- why a task was delegated
- what the result was

A task memory ledger preserves that history in a retrievable form.

## Example

A purchasing workflow has:

- planning agent
- vendor lookup agent
- risk agent
- approval agent

Each delegation becomes a memory entry. Later agents can query:

- which vendors were already rejected?
- what risks were already identified?
- which approval conditions failed?

## Mnemonic value in this pattern

- persistent task history
- semantic recall across previous tasks
- auditable sequence of task execution
- reduced redundant work in long-running agent workflows

## Best fit

Strong for enterprise workflows, research pipelines, operational assistants, and compliance-sensitive agent systems.
