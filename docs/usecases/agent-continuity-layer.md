# Agent Continuity Layer

## Pattern summary

Use Mnemonic as the continuity layer that lets an A2A agent preserve useful memory across runtime, provider, and infrastructure changes.

## What gets preserved

Mnemonic can preserve:

- previous memory items
- project context
- artifact history
- key findings
- prior decisions
- semantically retrievable history

## Why this pattern is useful

A2A assumes heterogeneous agents, but heterogeneous systems change over time.

An agent may move because of:

- cost changes
- model upgrades
- framework migrations
- infrastructure failures
- compliance constraints

Without a continuity layer, the agent can interoperate today but lose accumulated context tomorrow.

## Example

An agent starts on one provider, then moves to another after a model upgrade.

Mnemonic is used to:

- restore raw memory payloads
- rebuild retrieval state
- preserve prior project history
- continue operating in the same collaborative environment

## Mnemonic value in this pattern

- continuity across provider changes
- runtime-independent durable memory
- reduced restart cost for long-lived agents
- portable project history tied to the agent or namespace

## Best fit

Especially useful for long-running autonomous or semi-autonomous agents that must survive infrastructure change without losing context.
